            Who am I? I am still lost and finding myself. I went through arranged paths since I was born. I went to the same education institutions as my sister and graduated from the course that was believed to have good future. But I resigned because I lost myself in high pressure working environment.

            People would expect you to get a life partner, good pay when you get into your mid-20s and settle down after that. That goes the same with me. I am 26 years old,single and a freelancer. So life was tough and it will get tougher.
